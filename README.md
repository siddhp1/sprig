ConnectX is a variant of Connect 4, where two players battle it out over 10 rounds, from Connect 3 to Connect 12. The player that takes the most rounds wins the game! ConnectX was built for **[Sprig Consoles]([https://sprig.hackclub.com/](https://github.com/siddhp1/ConnectX/blob/main/SPRIG.md))** using the **[Sprig Online Editor](https://sprig.hackclub.com/editor)**, created by **[Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/)**. 

This repository is a fork of the main Hack Club Sprig Repository. As a result, there are many files that are created by the Hack Club organiztion and other contributors.
